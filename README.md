This mod reworks AnvilMenu mechanics, completely changing the costs of anvil operations (and resulting in cheaper operations in most cases).

Things to note:

1. In Vanilla, it was often optimal to pair enchantments together when combining large amounts together: if you had 8 enchanted books, each with 1 enchantment, you would make 4 books with 2 enchantments each, and then 2 books with 4 enchantments each, until finally you had one book with all 8 enchantments. Because this mod removes "prior work penalty", the opposite is now true: it may often be optimal to add books one at a time until all enchantments are present.
2. Although this mod tries its best to mimic all vanilla anvil recipes, this is not guaranteed.
